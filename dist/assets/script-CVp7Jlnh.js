This is a big problem for global food security because enzymatic browning, microbial spoilage, and rapid deterioration shorten their shelf life. This study looks at how well potato starch-based edible coatings, improved with 2% glycerol, keep whole and minimally processed apples (Malus domestica) fresh. We took starch out of Solanum tuberosum cv. Kufri Pukhraj, measured its moisture (19.0%), amylose (19.4%), and water binding capacity (604%), and made a 4% (w/v) solution that was dipped and then stored at 4–7°C (refrigerated) or 25°C (ambient). Whole apples that were coated lasted longer on the shelf—up to 60 days compared to 10 days for uncoated controls. Cut apples lasted up to 30 days compared to 5 days. Some of the main ways this worked were by creating a modified atmosphere (which made it harder for oxygen to get through), creating a moisture barrier (which controlled increases of 6.3–8.7% in cut and 16.3–19.5% in whole), stopping browning by inhibiting polyphenol oxidase, and killing bacteria through glycerol. Coated samples had better phytochemical stability: antioxidant activity went up slightly (cut: 0.1466–0.1545%; whole: 0.2851–0.2914%), and flavonoids went up (cut: 0.689–0.781 mg/100g; whole: 0.878–0.956 mg/100g), while uncoated samples' levels went down because of oxidative degradation. Coated fruits kept their best sensory qualities (appearance, smell, taste, color, and texture) and didn't get soggy or taste bad. Potato starch coatings are better than wax-based methods because they don't leave behind synthetic residues, are GRAS, biodegradable, and have resistant starch benefits like helping to control blood sugar. These results support the use of scalable, environmentally friendly preservation methods in supply chains with limited resources, which will lower losses after harvest.",keywords:["Edible coating","Potato starch","Shelf life extension","Antioxidant activity","Minimally processed fruits"]},"article-2":{type:"RESEARCH ARTICLE",title:"Assessment of Commercial Handwashes for Antimicrobial Activity and Maintenance of Hand Hygiene",authors:[{name:"Nancy Tiwari",affiliation:1},{name:"Akhilesh Chaurasiya",affiliation:1},{name:"Deepansh Sharma",affiliation:1},{name:"Deepti Singh",affiliation:1}],affiliations:["Directorate of Learning and Development, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India 603203"],doi:"XXXXXXXXX",pages:"14-26",publishedDate:"December 2025",abstract:"Effective hand hygiene is essential for reducing the transmission of infectious diseases in both community and healthcare environments.

This study assessed the antibacterial efficacy of eight commercially available handwashes (HW1 – HW8) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion method, with zones of inhibition measured to evaluate antimicrobial performance. Among the tested products, HW8, HW5, and HW4 demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against all test organisms, while HW7 showed the least activity. To evaluate the effectiveness of handwashing in reducing microbial load, optical density (OD at 600 nm) measurements were taken from samples collected from the palms of 20 volunteers before and after washing with HW8. Results indicated a notable reduction in microbial load following handwashing, with percentage reductions ranging from 28.98% to 66.67%. The highest reductions were recorded for Volunteer 6 (66.67%), Volunteer 16 (65.98%), and Volunteer 10 (63.78%), reflecting efficient removal of microbial contaminants.

Under conditions of 1 g adsorbent, 2 hours of contact time, and an initial concentration of 50 mg/l, maximum removal reached 91% with a loading capacity of 2.25 mg per gram. FTIR analysis confirmed the binding of chromium to Dextrin White. The experimental data were analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models, with the Langmuir model providing a better fit—indicating monolayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface.
